And tbh I have wished I had answers for those before we even talked about it today. But hear me out... going back to to what you told me in the beginning, you know God exists. You know the story of Christ is true— meaning he came to earth, suffered for our sins and pains and rose again. Going on a mission really is focused on bringing others closer to God.

Since they say this is 100% the true church, then it is either that or not. And if it’s not, then that changes everything. Essentially, it’s all gotta be right, and if it’s not all right, then none of the stuff that makes this church different from the rest can seemingly be right  "},{"is_from_me":"1","text":"Like, I know, I’m doing all that kinda stuff, and i definitely have like impressions while reading the scriptures, and occasionally at church and all that, but"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"But say you give it a shot, start with modern revelation or the covenant path or something like that.

I know it because the fruits of this gospel provide so much logical confirmation to my mind and the peace and spiritual experiences I’ve had with the church confirm it to me also. And if I didn’t care about ya, I wouldn’t talk to you about this. But I know God is aware of us  and loves us and He has given us resources to figure out what is right and what is wrong. I really admire how thoughtful you are when making any decision, political or spiritual or otherwise. But just remember logic doesn’t hold all the answers. I don’t hold all the answers either, though I love talking to ya! Talk to God tho. He is the ultimate source. God is real. You know that.

We were all like “what the heck dude you’re gonna die” but then my ant-man suit friend flew down (I guess he could fly as well) and caught the guy who jumped off and returned him back to where the rest of us were standing. 2. In this dream world, I had gone to some dance this year with a girl who was wearing a teal\/turquoise dress. I don’t remember who she was, and even in my dream, I thought of like every girl that I currently know, and the girl that I had gone to the dance with was none of them. But like, in my mind, I still have a very clear picture of us two posing together, and the picture is very clear.

I was about to comment that I had just has a dream about the room that we were in when this weird song started playing from the other room and she asked what it was. I said that everybody was humming the halo theme song, but when we went back into the room, it was just like 5 or 6 guys standing up in the front of the room, singing an a capella doo-wop song for everyone else.

You’ve known this guy for not even 4 months, have been anything close to a ‘thing’ for less than 3, and you broke up before things got serious. This is freshman year of college.

It’s really nice to read back through a journal (ngl that’s most of why I’m up this late) and realize that all of the things you were worried about turned out fine. And it’s all good even tho you weren’t sure. That’s just a nice feeling. 2.  I’m probably not gonna go on a mission this summer. Since November, I’ve been trying to pray to know for myself that like this is the true church and the book of morning is true and if I should go on a mission this summer or not, and I haven’t yet gotten like any definite responses. I talked to Bishop, and he said to just not go if you don’t get a specific witness for yourself to go, but I also emailed Ryker and both he and that guy who gave a devotional for both of our wards (can’t remember his name) recommended to just go for it and stop if you feel you should stop. But I can’t lie to Bishop and say I feel really strongly that I should go, even if I decided to just go for it, cause I seriously feel like I should not go on a mission at all. Idk man. But it’s kinda screwing up my plans and unless I get some strong feeling that seriously tells me to go on my mission by like March 1, I’m probably just gonna plan to sign up for fall semester and get some new housing. We’ll see. I hope you enjoyed 2:30 am thoughts with Ian :)"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"You know, I actually really support you. I think my opinion really is that we need to have a testimony before we go through the temple and go on a mission. And if you feel you can’t answer those interview questions with confidence yet, then that’s okay. If you have even a desire to believe then you’re totally in the right place. Just don’t give up because I promise this all is true. I have worked hard for my testimony as well and I know you can feel it also. I also thought I’d tell you, I never got any strong feeling that I should serve a mission. It felt very much like my decision and so I’m just choosing to go :) and I know a lot of people I’ve talked to are that way. I think also for you, if you develop a testimony of the church and of modern prophets, then you will feel their invitation for every able and willing young man to serve a mission truly apply to you and you will want to serve. So my advice is don’t worry so much about a mission, but focus first on those central pieces of the gospel and everything else will fall into place :)"},{"text":"Are you at stake conference?","is_from_me":"0"},{"is_from_me":"1","text":"Yup"},{"text":"You?","is_from_me":"1"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"Yeppp"},{"is_from_me":"1","text":"There’s like a weirdly small amount of people here, only half of my dinner table went to it"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"Yeah we were just talking about how we have a quarter of the elders quorum is here lol"},{"text":"Yeah we probably have about the same","is_from_me":"1"},{"text":"Would you mind helping me with a short chemistry thing really quick?","is_from_me":"1"},{"text":"I can tryyy","is_from_me":"0"},{"text":"How can you tell if a molecule is a polar molecule?","is_from_me":"1"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"Like C-O"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"If electronegativity is great between them"},{"is_from_me":"0","text":"do you have a table of EN values?"},{"text":"Nah but I can get one","is_from_me":"1"},{"text":"Otherwise I think F Cl and O are polar...","is_from_me":"0"},{"is_from_me":"1","text":"Well like say you just know the chemical formula and you know that at least one of the bonds in it is polar.
