# SMServer
Hopefully this will soon be a SwiftUI app which can host a local webserver and send and receive text messages on an ios device through an accompanying pc/linux application. I'm still working on it, though. 

## TODO

- [x] View conversations in browser
- [x] View texts in browser
- [x] Send texts (mostly) from browser
- [ ] Send texts without on-device interaction
- [x] View images in browser
- [ ] Send images from browser
- [ ] Send attachments from browser
- [ ] Display new messages when they arrive
- [x] Display notifier for which conversations have unread messages
- [ ] Search through messages from browser

## To Install
This is definitely still in Alpha stages; there are still countless issues and features that need to be implemented. However, if you do want to test it or use it for the time being, the steps are pretty simple:

1. Clone this repository
2. CD into the directory where the podfile is installed
3. If cocoapods are not installed, run 'sudo gem install cocoapods'
4. Run 'pod intall'
5. Open the .xcworkspace file in Xcode
6. Build and install the project!

## Issues
If there are any issues or feature requests at all, don't hesitate to create an issue or pull request here. I may not run into all issues that could possibly come up, so I would really appreciate any issues you let me know about.

## Companion App
Currently, there is a python companion app in the works; it is compatible with this and the mac version of this app but I'm not releasing it yet for reasons I am not quite sure of. Wait a bit and it'll be out soon.
